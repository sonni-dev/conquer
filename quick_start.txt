🎯 HOW THE TIERED SYSTEM WORKS:

BEFORE (old way):
- "Clean kitchen" = one way to do it, pass/fail

AFTER (new way):
- 🔥 HIGH ENERGY: Load/unload dishwasher, wipe ALL counters, clean stove, 
  scrub sink, trash out, sweep & mop (50 XP)
  
- ⚡ MEDIUM ENERGY: Load dishwasher, wipe main counters, clean stove, 
  trash out, quick sweep (30 XP)
  
- 🌙 LOW ENERGY: Load dirty dishes (sink clear), wipe main counter, 
  trash out (15 XP)

ALL THREE COUNT! The low energy version is NOT a failure - it's you 
doing what you could with what you had. That deserves credit.

💡 GETTING STARTED:

1. Check out the DASHBOARD
   - See your level, XP, streaks
   - View Life Balance to see which categories need attention
   - Browse sample tasks

2. Click the ✓ on any task
   - You'll see all three energy tiers
   - Pick the one that matches what you actually did
   - Earn XP and maintain your streak!

3. Use QUEST SELECT
   - Filter by your current energy (High/Medium/Low)
   - Find tasks that match how you're feeling right now
   - No pressure to do the "high energy" version

4. CREATE YOUR OWN TASKS
   - Click "Add Task"
   - Define all three tiers for your real tasks
   - Assign to a life category

🧠 THE ADHD/DEPRESSION DESIGN:

- **Variable Energy**: Some days making tea is 1 step, some days it's 4. 
  The system gets it.

- **No All-or-Nothing**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of done. Low energy 
  completion still earns XP and maintains your streak.

- **Category Balance**: See if you're neglecting self-care, social connection, 
  or other life areas. No judgment - just awareness.

- **Choose When Completing**: Even if you filtered for "high energy" tasks, 
  you can still pick the low energy version when completing if the task 
  felt harder than expected.

📊 UNDERSTANDING THE DASHBOARD:

- **Life Balance**: Shows tasks completed per category this week. Helps 
  you see patterns - like "I did 5 work tasks but 0 self-care tasks"

- **Today's Completions**: Shows what tier you completed (High/Medium/Low) 
  so you can track your energy patterns

- **Streak**: Complete at least ONE task per day (any tier!) to maintain

🛠️ CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS:

Sample tasks are there to help you understand the system. Replace them with:

- Your actual cleaning routines
- Your real work tasks
- Your specific self-care needs
- Things you tend to forget (like Doby's nails!)

For each task, think:
- What's the IDEAL way to do this? (High)
- What's the REALISTIC way? (Medium)  
- What's the MINIMUM that still counts? (Low)

🔮 TIPS FOR SUCCESS:

1. Be honest about what tier you completed - the system only helps if 
   you're real with yourself

2. On good days, aim for high energy versions to bank XP

3. On rough days, celebrate the low energy wins - you showed up!

4. Use category balance to guide your task choices - pick from 
   neglected areas

5. Don't forget Doby! (Or whatever tasks you typically avoid)

📝 REMEMBER:

This isn't about productivity optimization. It's about sustainable progress
that works WITH your brain, not against it. Some days you'll crush high
energy tasks. Some days you'll barely manage low energy ones. Both are 
valid. Both count. Both earn XP.

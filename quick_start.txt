🗡️ CONQUER - QUICK START GUIDE
================================

Welcome to Conquer! Your ADHD-friendly task tracker with checkable subtasks.

🎯 THE BIG IDEA
===============
Instead of "Clean Kitchen" being one big task, you get a CHECKLIST:
  ☐ Load dishes
  ☐ Wipe counter  
  ☐ Take out trash

Each checkbox = dopamine hit!

The subtasks you see depend on YOUR ENERGY:
  🌙 Low = 3 subtasks (bare minimum)
  ⚡ Medium = 5 subtasks (includes low + medium tasks)
  🔥 High = 9 subtasks (includes all tasks)

🚀 GET STARTED
==============

1. Start the app:
   python app.py

2. Open browser to:
   http://localhost:5000

3. Browse Templates page

4. Pick a template (like "Clean the Kitchen")

5. Choose your energy level (be honest!)

6. Task appears on dashboard - click it!

7. CHECK OFF SUBTASKS as you do them 📝✓

8. Complete quest when done (50%+ required)

9. Earn XP, maintain streak, feel good! 🎉

🧠 WHY THIS WORKS FOR ADHD
===========================

✓ Variable energy recognition
  (Some days tea is 1 step, some days it's 4)

✓ Dopamine on demand
  (Every checkbox, not just at the end)

✓ No all-or-nothing thinking
  (Low energy completion still counts!)

✓ Visual progress
  (Watch the progress bar fill up)

✓ Flexible without overwhelming
  (Start low, upgrade if you feel good)

📝 QUICK TIPS
=============

1. Be HONEST about energy
   Pick what matches NOW, not what you wish

2. Low energy is VALID
   Did the minimum? That's still progress!

3. Use the checkboxes
   That's where the dopamine is!

4. Check category balance
   Neglecting self-care? Pick from that category

5. Upgrade when motivated
   Feeling good after finishing? Keep going!
